InetAddress:
  - Use read/write locks when searching/updating the cache.
  - Better address factory instantiation in thread environment.
  - Better caching for multiple entries after host resolution.
  - A method to get a loopback address
  - Implement IPv6 support class (mostly unsupported operations for now).
  - Implement getCanonicalHostName()
  - Better implementation for getLocalHost(), now returns IPv6 address on Mac.
  - Recognize the case when getByName() is given IP address string.
  - Add a method to clean the cache.
  - Implement better cache indexing, now searches are done sequentially.

    For sk::rt::Actions, implement method to help with going through all
    possible implementations:
      performUntilSuccess(reverseErrors = false) 

    When it gets to a successful action, it stops and returns without errors
    even if some were collected before. If all actions end up with exceptions,
    throw all in CompoundExceptions, reversing the list if reverseErrors is
    true.
