InetAddress:
===========
  - Use read/write locks when searching/updating the cache. Currently, it
    uses simple mutexes.
  - Better address factory instantiation in thread environment.
  - Better caching for multiple entries after host resolution.
  - Implement IPv6 support class (mostly unsupported operations for now).
  - Implement getCanonicalHostName()
  - Better implementation for getLocalHost(), now returns IPv6 address on Mac.
  - Recognize the case when getByName() is given IP address string.
  - Implement better cache indexing, now searches are done sequentially.

  + [DONE]
    - A method to get a loopback and "any local" address.
    - Add a method to clean the cache.
    - For sk::rt::Actions, implement method to help with going through all
      possible implementations:
        performUntilSuccess(reverseErrors = false) 

      When it gets to a successful action, it stops and returns without errors
      even if some were collected before. If all actions end up with exceptions,
      throw all in CompoundExceptions, reversing the list if reverseErrors is
      true. 

ServerSocket/Socket:
===================
  - Add more options. Currently only setReuseAddresss() is implemented.

  + [DONE]
    - Implement socket opiton settings, possibly via AbstractSocket class. See if 
      it may host some other information.
